# Querying Amazon Pinpoint Analytics Data<a name="analytics"></a>

In addition to using the Analytics pages on the Amazon Pinpoint console, you can use the Amazon Pinpoint API to query analytics data for a subset of metrics that provide insight into trends related to user engagement, campaign outreach, and more\. These metrics, also referred to as a *key performance indicators \(KPIs\)*, are measurable values that can help you monitor and assess the performance of your projects and campaigns\.

By using the Amazon Pinpoint API, you can access data for two types of standard metrics:
+ **Application metrics** – These metrics provide insight into trends for all the campaigns that are associated with a project, also referred to as an *application*\. For example, you can use an application metric to see a breakdown of the number of campaign messages that were opened by recipients for each campaign that's associated with a project\. To query data for these metrics, you use the [Application Metrics resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-kpis-daterange-kpi-name.html) of the Amazon Pinpoint API\. This resource represents the collection of standard application metrics that you can query by using the API\. 
+ **Campaign metrics** – These metrics provide insight into the performance of individual campaigns\. For example, you can use a campaign metric to access data about how many endpoints a campaign message was sent to or how many of those messages were delivered to the intended endpoints\. To query data for these metrics, you use the [Campaign Metrics resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-campaigns-campaign-id-kpis-daterange-kpi-name.html) of the Amazon Pinpoint API\. This resource represents the collection of standard campaign metrics that you can query by using the API\.

Amazon Pinpoint automatically collects and aggregates data for both types of metrics and for all of your projects and campaigns\. In addition, the data is updated continuously, resulting in a data latency timeframe that’s limited to approximately two hours\. Amazon Pinpoint stores the data for 90 days\.

To query the data for a metric by using the Amazon Pinpoint API, you send an HTTP GET request to the Application Metrics or Campaign Metrics URI, depending on the metric that you want to query\. In your request, you define your query by using path and query parameters:
+ **Project** – To specify a project, provide the project ID as the value for the `application-id` path parameter\. 
+ **Campaign** – To specify a campaign, provide the campaign ID as the value for the `campaign-id` path parameter\.
+ **Date range** – To specify a date range, provide the first and last date and time of the date range by using the `start-time` and `end-time` query parameters\. The values should be in extended ISO 8601 format—for example, `2019-07-19T00:00:00Z` for July 19, 2019 and `2019-07-19T20:00:00Z` for 8:00 PM July 19, 2019\. Note that date ranges are inclusive and must be limited to 31 or fewer calendar days\.
+ **Metric** – To specify a metric, provide the name of the metric as the value for the `kpi-name` path parameter\. For a complete list of supported metrics and the `kpi-name` value to use for each one, see the Metrics topics later in this section\.

You can also query data by using the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\. To query the data for an application metric by using the AWS CLI, use the GetApplicationDateRangeKpi command\. To query the data for a campaign metric, use the GetCampaignDateRangeKpi command\. When you use either command, include the preceding parameters and arguments to define your query\.

After you send your query, Amazon Pinpoint returns the query results in a JSON response and, depending on the metric, groups the results by date, campaign ID, or another relevant field\. You can then pass the results to another service or application for deeper analysis, storage, or reporting\.

## Application Metrics<a name="application-metrics"></a>

The following table lists and describes standard application metrics that you can query by using the [Application Metrics resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-kpis-daterange-kpi-name.html) of the Amazon Pinpoint API or the GetApplicationDateRangeKpi command in the AWS CLI\. The **kpi\-name** column indicates the value to use as the `kpi-name` parameter when you query the data for a metric\.
