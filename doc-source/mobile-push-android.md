# Setting Up Android Push Notifications<a name="mobile-push-android"></a>

Push notifications for Android apps are sent using Firebase Cloud Messaging \(FCM\), which replaces Google Cloud Messaging \(GCM\)\. Before you can send push notifications to Android devices, you must obtain FCM credentials, which you can then use to create an Android project and launch a sample app that can receive push notifications\. You can find more information about completing these steps in [Setting Up FCM/GCM for Push Notifications](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/android/push-notifications-setup-fcm) in the Android SDK documentation\.
