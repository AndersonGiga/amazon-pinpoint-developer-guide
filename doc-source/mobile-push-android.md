# Setting Up Android Push Notifications<a name="mobile-push-android"></a>

This section describes how to obtain the credentials required to send push notifications to Android apps\. The platform notification services you can use for push notifications on Android are Firebase Cloud Messaging \(FCM\)\. You can use your FCM credentials to create an Android project and launch a sample app that can receive push notifications\. You can find more information about completing these steps in [Setting Up FCM/GCM for Push Notifications](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/android/push-notifications-setup-fcm) in the Android SDK documentation\.
