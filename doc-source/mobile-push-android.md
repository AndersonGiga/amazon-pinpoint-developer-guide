# Setting Up Android Push Notifications<a name="mobile-push-android"></a>

This section describes how to obtain the credentials required to send push notifications to Android apps\. The platform notification services you can use for push notifications on Android are Firebase Cloud Messaging \(FCM\) and its predecessor, Google Cloud Messaging \(GCM\)\. Your FCM or GCM credentials enable you to create an Android project in AWS Mobile Hub and launch a sample app that can receive push notifications\.

You do not need an existing Android app to complete the steps in this section\. After you create an Android project in Mobile Hub, you can download and launch a working sample app\. Mobile Hub automatically provisions the AWS resources that your app requires\.
