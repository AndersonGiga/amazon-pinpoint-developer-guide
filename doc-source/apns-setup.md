# Setting Up iOS Push Notifications<a name="apns-setup"></a>

Push notifications for iOS apps are sent using Apple Push Notification service \(APNs\)\. Before you can send push notifications to iOS devices, you must create an app ID on the Apple Developer portal, and you must create the required certificates\. You can find more information about completing these steps in [Setting Up APNs for Push Notifications](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/ios/push-notifications-setup-apns) in the iOS SDK documentation\.
